<p>lately you make have heard of the term "keto". Keto has turned into a sort of buzz word. Keto is short for the<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-101#what-it-is"> Ketogenic diet.</a> If this diet is done properly it could help you lose weight and become more healthy.<br>
The main part of the keto diet is how you fuel your body. Most people get energy by eating carbs. Growing up people were told that fat is bad so mot people have a high carb low fat diet. On keto you switch that.<br>
You will fuel your body with fat. You will have a high fat and low to no carb diet. Your body will produce ketones to help burn that fat efficently. You body will naturally produce these keytones over time. <br>
Once the body build up enough you enter the ketosis stage. During this stage is when you will start using your fat as a energy source. Since the fat you are eating is needed to fuel you body it dosnt have time<br> 
to settle as fat in you body. The keytones will attach to the fat for fuel. With carbs, if you dont use them as energy right away they turn to fat to store for later.<br>
</p>
