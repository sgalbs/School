<h1>What is the keto diet?</h1>

<p>lately you make have heard of the term "keto". Keto has turned into a sort of buzz word. Keto is short for the<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-101#what-it-is"> Ketogenic diet.</a> If this diet is done properly it could help you lose weight and become more healthy.<br>
The main part of the keto diet is how you fuel your body. Most people get energy by eating carbs. Growing up people were told that fat is bad so mot people have a high carb low fat diet. On keto you switch that.<br>
You will fuel your body with fat. You will have a high fat and low to no carb diet. Your body will produce ketones to help burn that fat efficiently. You body will naturally produce these ketones over time. <br>
Once the body build up enough you enter the ketosis stage. During this stage is when you will start using your fat as a energy source. Since the fat you are eating is needed to fuel your body it doesn’t have time<br> 
to settle as fat in your body. The ketones will attach to the fat for fuel. With carbs, if you don’t use them as energy right away, they turn to fat to store for later.
</p>

<h3>Basic breakdown</h3>
<p>With Keto the grams of carbs per day is usually between 20 and 30 grams. Most people try to stay around 20 grams. The macro breakdown (per gram) is based on your goal caloric intake. You can use an online calculator to<br>
figure out how many calories you should eat a day for weight loss. Most of those calculators will recommend a 500 or 750 calorie deficit. Then based on that calorie goal used the following percentages to get you daily macros<br>
per gram: 75% Fat, 25% Protein and 5% carbs. There are apps that will set this up for you or, again, online calculators. I suggest using an app to track your food intake.<br>
<br>
Going forward you should know the difference between Total Carbs and Net Carbs. Carbs are the just that, look at the nutrition facts of food, boom there are your carbs. Net carbs will require a little math. You will take the<br>
grams of carbs minus any dietary fiber and sugar alcohols. Some people will consider this “dirty keto”. Don’t view that as bad though. I’ll explain it below.</p>

<h2>What can I eat?</h2>
<img src="/img/Cutting board.jpg" alt="Cutting board with food on it" style="width:607px;height:607px;">
<p>While on the keto diet you are going to change how you eat (of course). You will have to cut out carbs almost entirely. Anything that is bread or breaded, pastas, sugars, most fruits. You need to stick with unprocessed food as much as possible.<br>
Focus on cuts of meat, dark green leafy vegetables, and healthy fats. For meat you can have most unprocessed meat to include steak, ground beef, chicken, porkchops, etc. Stay away from meats in a can or otherwise. You can have pepperoni slices and<br>
deli meat for lunch and as a snack. A lot of your vegetable choices might be limited. No more starchy vegetables like corn, potatoes, and most forms of squash. Spinach, zucchini and cauliflower are ok. Just be mindful of carbs and service size. the only<br>
fruits you can have are berries like strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, etc.<br>
<br>
Your goal is to stay under 20g of carbs per day. To put it in perspective, a normal frozen pizza from the store close to (if not over) 100 grams of carbs. That being said this doesn’t mean you can eat one slice then nothing for the rest of the day.<br>
you still have to stay away from bread, flours, starches, sugar, etc.</p>

<h1>The difference between strict, lazy and dirty keto</h1>
<img src="/img/berries.jpg" alt="Berries in heart shape bowl" style="width:483px;height:295px;">
<p>There are three way to do the keto diet. You have strict keto, lazy keto, and dirty keto. If you would like a more detailed breakdown please click on this <a href="https://macrofare.com/hub/keto-diet/the-difference-between-the-strict-lazy-and-dirty-keto-diet/#:~:text=The%20dirty%20keto%20diet%20is,of%20the%20strict%20keto%20diet."> link.</a></p>

<h2>Strict Keto</h2>
<p>Most people will do this method when starting out. This is exactly how it sounds. You are strict to the diet. You will track your calories and other macros of EVERYTHING you eat. Staying at or under 20 grams per day is keto. Some people will use<br>
total carbs to get into ketosis a little faster. You can also do Net Carbs to give you a little more options. Stick to meat, dark leafy green vegetables, full fat dairy, and real butter. If its spreadable or in a tub it’s probably has bad oils in it.<br>
Healthy fat is good too, coconut & avocado oils and nuts. If you need some sweets you can have berries, just in moderation.</p>

<h2>Lazy Keto</h2>
<p>Once you get the hang of the diet and know what you can and can’t eat you can do the lazy approach. You still stick to the high fat, low carb way of eating but maybe you just keep track of your total or net carbs (it will be a lot harder to do the <br>
lazy approach with total carb tracking). Some of the food you will eat will have a larger about of carbs then what you are use to like low carb tortillas. Just remember to stay at or around 20 grams of net carbs.</p>

<h2>Dirty Keto</h2>
<p>This is basically just eating whatever as long as you stay within your macros. Another example is also eating something pretty high in carbs BUT because it has a lot of dietary fiber the net carbs is actually zero (there is a brand of keto bread like this).<br>
Not sure of long-term effects on the diet eating like this but that can be up to you. As long as you don’t eat like this every day you should be fine.</p>

<h2>How to test ketone levels</h2>
<p>One question you may ask is how to know if you are in ketosis. You are able to test to see if your ketone levels are high or not. It is important to test your ketone levels every now and again. This is so you know that you are doing the diet correctly.<br>
<br>
    The most common ways to test ketones are:
<ul>
    <li>Blood Test</li>
    <li>Urine Test</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Blood Test</h3>
<p>One testing method, and the most accurate, is to test your blood. You can test your blood with a meter. The meter looks like one used by diabetics. The one i use can be found <a href="https://ketocoachx.com/">here</a> You just use a lancet to poke your finger.<br>
Then you touch the drop of blood to the strip that is inserted into the meter beforehand. Then you get your result. Based on your reading is your ketone level. You have a few levels to look for.<br>
<ol>
    <li>0.0 to 0.4 = Not in ketosis but normal level</li>
    <li>0.5 to 1.5 = A moderate level of ketones, usually indicates ketosis</li>
    <li>1.6 to 3.0 = A high level, this level could be dangerous to diabetes, and is unhealthy</li>
</ol>
It is possible to have high levels of ketones in your body but if you are eating properly you should never see levels that high.</p>

<h3>Urine Test</h3>
<p>The urine test is another way to test your ketone levels. It is less accurate and precise but it’s one of the cheapest methods. You can find a 100 pack of test strips for $10. The test strips have a little pad at the end<br>
that will react to the ketones in your urine. the pad on the end will change color based on your ketone levels. If there is no color change then you have little or no ketones and not in ketosis.<br>
In my personal experience this can vary from test to test. If you need something cheap then you can do this but I recommend the blood test.</p>
